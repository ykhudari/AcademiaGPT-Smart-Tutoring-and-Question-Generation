Artificial Intelligence (AI) in education is utilized to enhance the learning and teaching experiences for both students and instructors. These technologies have helped students and
educators across the world in promoting inclusivity in education. They not only have the potential to make education more accessible to diverse learners, but they also make the learning process more interactive and enjoyable.Our project aims at mobilizing this exciting development in AI to build a learning tool for the Jupyteach platform through Large Language Models, utilizing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG). There are mainly two modules associated with this platform, the AI Tutor and Question Generator.

#### AI Tutor: 
The purpose of the AI Tutor is to help give students a personalized learning
experience of specific topics through interactive methods. It also aims at engaging users in a dynamic and responsive learning environment in acquiring new skills and gaining knowledge.

#### Question Generator: 
The purpose of the question generator is to assist the instructors in creating questions for educational and assessment purposes.
